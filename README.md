Run `npm install` then `npm start` then kill it.

You can `open index.html`, wait a few seconds and see the app. Or you can `node server.js` and open `http://localhost:4000/` to see
the server rendered version. Note the better performance (due to simulated JS load time) and if you edit the text field the JS won't
blow it away when it loads.
